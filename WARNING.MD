# ⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPLICATE ANYTHING IN THIS MOD IN REAL LIFE ⚠️

This mod is a **fictional** addition to the game and is designed for **entertainment purposes only**.  
While corium production and uranium mining in this mod may be **highly realistic**, they should **ONLY be attempted in virtual environments**.  
**DO NOT attempt anything depicted in this mod in real life.**

## ☢️ DANGERS OF URANIUM MINING & CORIUM PRODUCTION  
- **Mining uranium** in real life is **extremely dangerous and illegal** without proper government authorization.  
  - Exposure to radioactive materials can cause **radiation poisoning, cancer, and environmental contamination**.  
- **Corium (or Curium) production** involves **highly radioactive materials** that **CANNOT** be safely handled  
  without specialized nuclear facilities.  
  - Attempting to recreate any process related to nuclear materials is **deadly** and **a serious criminal offense** in most countries.

## ❌ DO NOT TRY THIS IN REAL LIFE – VIRTUAL ATTEMPTS ONLY  
Any real-world attempt to mine uranium, refine nuclear materials, or experiment with radioactive substances **will** result in:  
✔ **Severe injury or death** from radiation exposure.  
✔ **Long-term health consequences**, including cancer and organ failure.  
✔ **Legal prosecution and imprisonment**, as nuclear material handling is **highly illegal**.
